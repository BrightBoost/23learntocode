## Exercise 1
- Implement a functional interface called Returner, that has a method giveValue that takes no args but returns an Object
- Write 3 different implementations for it in a class called App

## Exercise 2
- Implement a functional interface Concatenator, with a method concat that takes 3 strings and returns one string
- Create two different implementations (e.g. add a certain custom word to the concat)

## Exercise 3
- Implement a functional interface Processor with a method process that returns a boolean and processes an int
- Create two different implementations (e.g. bigger than 10 is true)
