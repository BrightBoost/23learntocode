- Create a new package for this exercise
- In the package, create the following classes: Vehicle, Car, Boat, Airplane
- Make logical relations between those classes
- Create an interface Chargeable
- Give the interface the method charge
- Create subclasses of the Car and Boat that implement the Chargeable interface, make those concrete (not abstract) classes
- Do what you must do to make the classes that implement the interfaces compile
- Create an ArrayList<Chargeable>, which vehicles can you add?
- Can you call the charge method on members of the arraylist?
