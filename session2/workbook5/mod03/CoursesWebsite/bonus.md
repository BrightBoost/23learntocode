## Exercise 1: Display All Instructors

**Objective**: Create a webpage that, upon loading, fetches and displays a list of all instructors. 
**Bonus**: Use a list (ul) instead of a table

## Exercise 2: Display Instructor Details

**Objective**: Extend the previous exercise to allow users to click on an instructor's name to view detailed information about them.

## CHALLENGE: Display Courses for a Specific Instructor

**Objective**: Populate a dropdown with all the instructors on page load. Upon selecting an instructor's name, display a list of all courses taught by that instructor.

For this to work seamlessly, you might need to introduce a new endpoint that provides all courses for a specific instructor (you can use the name to make the match). You can also get away with looping in a smart way through the existing endpoints.
