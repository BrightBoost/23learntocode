## Exercise 1
- a checkbox for liking or not liking an image, underneath an image
- when the checkbox is checked (like), the image should get a green border
- when the checkbox is unchecked, the image should get a red border
- initially, it shouldn't have a border


## Exercise 2
- I want a page with a checkbox for "light on", it should also have an image of a light that is off
- If the checkbox is checked, the image needs to be replaced by one that is on
- Bonus: add a checkbox broken, if that checkbox is checked, checking the light on checkbox should be impossible
